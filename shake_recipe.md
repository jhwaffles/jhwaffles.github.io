Tangent - This was essentially a technology transfer (a big part of my current job)

I started with a recipe and instructions (batch record). Then I give a demonstration (lab visit and technology transfer). Then taste test (assys and quality). They demonstrated batch to batch reproducibility (quality). One part of the record involves dealing with a limitation of the equipment (blender can only hold 8 cups). so designed a way to make the chia seeds with water first and set it aside. to make it easier and save time but not introduce error. Then total water has to subtract the volume from the chia seeds. So have to transfer the knowledge as well as the context for why this is the case.

Also some safety things like holding the blender down while blending so things dont tip over. how to use the settings (ramp up from low setting). And how to clean with soap and water. basic stuff but reemphasizing this is my job.
