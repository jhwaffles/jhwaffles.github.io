## Visiting Parents

My dad has always been interested in losing weight. Although he enjoys watching sports, exercise itself has always been a chore for him. Running outside was hard on the knees. He didn't like to go to the gym either. I bought a treadmill but it went primarily unused. He has tried dieting - previous attempts included calorie counting but never incurred any lasting habits/change in weight. Mostly he just felt hungry and reverted back to normal habits.

My dad had many reasons for wanting to lose weight. Family members (including my grandparents when they were around) constantly told him to lose weight. Health was a big reason - his doctor said he needed to lose 20 lbs to be in better condition. I personally think his greatest reason was simple - he just wanted to look better in photos. I should mention that my dad is retired.

Hearing this discontent, Cynthia wondered if there was anything functional medicine/dieting could do to help my dad. It seemed like he was genuinely interested in losing weight but he was discouraged by previous attempts. In the midst of a sunny hike in the Oakland hills, we discussed putting my parents on a “program” of a low carb/diet, focus on losing weight (My mom was also interested, not because she needed to lose weight, more out of FOMO). Coming off of a recent “program” for ourselves (Link), we talked of guiding my parents through a similar program.

## The plan

Here is what we came up with: my parents would go on a meal plan (crafted by Cynthia) for 3 weeks. After that they were free to eat whatever they wanted again. Cynthia and I would stay at my parents place for 2 of those weeks and prepare foods for them and encourage them to follow through. During this period we would also go on a walk or exercise for at least 30 minutes every day.

We told them about this "offer". Although hesitant, my dad was eventually persuaded and accepted.

As for the meal plan, we really wanted to limit the carbohydrates and digestible sugars.

-No rice, noodles, breads, or grains.
-No dairy
-Limited Fruits (Berries are ok)
-Berry/greens shake in the morning.
-Tofu is OK
-Soy is OK
-Beef, seafood, are OK

It was important to match the meals to their taste. Meaning we incorporated asian ingredients and seasoning (soy sauce, tofu, ginger, etc) into the meals.

### 1st week (June 18-June 25)

Our first week started with a trip to costco together. We also incorporated some foods they already had in the fridge. Here are some of the foods we ate the first week:

Luckily a lot of the dishes and sides my parents liked were compatible for this diet so it wasnt too hard to adjust the menu and cooking. For example zha ziang mian (Black bean sauce noodle) is something they eat often and had the sauce for. We substituted the usual noodles with shirataki noodles (0g digestible carbohydrates. My mom also has a stash of fake meat products (mostly soy protein) that we incorporated into the meals.

One added challenge was my dad really enjoys eating meat but my mom is vegan. So often had to prepare multiple dishes. You can see the meals turned into a bunch of dishes.

We also committed to go on a walk every evening. We talked about a range of topics including iphones+file storage, diabetes and insulin pathways, Popeyes fried chicken, and cremation.

There were a moments of low energy (maybe due to low blood sugar), but my parents remained very upbeat. Dad lost 3 kg in the first week! GJ dad!

### 2nd week (June 25-July 02)

One week has passed and we are adjusting to the routine. Here are some of the foods.

The parents are getting more into it and even contribute to making and preparing the foods. They are learning fast on what foods should/should not be eaten on this diet. We also demonstrated how to read a nutrition label and how to look for sugars/carbohydrates amounts.

Dad was interested in learning how to make the morning shake so I gave a demonstration (Link). Pretty soon he was off and making his own shakes!

By this time work was getting busy and the day-to-day included driving to and back from work, cooking meals, going on a walk, then passing out. This period was exhausting but having Cynthia made it easier. It also helped that parents were learning and contributing. We realized the important thing was to continue building habits.

### 3rd week (July 03-July 10)

By now the parents had the hang of things. I checked in every few days to see what food they prepared and if they had kept up with exercise. My parents were very diligent about sticking to the plan.

Every morning my dad would send a picture in our group chat showing off his weight. It was awesome to see since it was one part of the day he was looking forward to the most (because of the progress). I shared a tracker I implemented on google sheets to log weight and exercise activity. With the aid of the bar chart, progress was easy to visualize.

After three weeks of commitment to the plan with home cooked meals mostly every day it was time to celebrate. It was a great bonding time, and **dad lost over 4 kg in 3 weeks.** FurthermoreHere is us getting a bowl in San Jose:

## Aftermath (August).

Dad continually updates us on his weight every day. It looks my parents took parts of the 3 week program and continued going. They continued to be mindful of their food and limit carbs and went on walks nearly every day. It was even more exciting to see my dad continue to lose weight.

At one point my dad was below 82 kg, over 7 kg lower than the start (2 months ago)!

We also wanted to help my parents expand their exercise beyond walking. We decided to go to the park nearby to demonstrate some stretching and exercises (led by Cynthia).

In retrospect the visit was productive for all parties. Cynthia and I learned a great deal and got to spend quality time with my parents. My mom and dad built healthier habits, and continued to follow through even after the three week plan. On paper, the plan of limiting carbs and regular exercise was backed by science but what made it effective was getting the parents involved in process, the conversations during dinner and walks, and ultimately our presence and support.

For example, Dad came with us to shop and purchase food. The act of us cooking and preparing meals for 2 weeks straight allowed him plenty of chances to watch, and critique (lol).

During the time parents had lots of questions. We had talks about nutrition labels, and what was considered nutritious and what was not (processed sugars). We explained the mechanism in which the body processed sugar and what leads to diabetes (Link). Cynthia is the expert on health and has a lot of knowledge. My role was to support the convos and clarify/emphasize points.

Also **very important** and probably the biggest factor: The parents have been really easy to work with so far and have been very positive. They had an open mind going into this whole thing which was crucial.

All in all it was a very positive experience for me and I'm confident we were able to build lasting habits/awareness on food!
