<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver the past year I’ve been experimenting through diet. What kind of experiments you ask?</p>

I have always had an interest in experimenting with food and diet. Through reading articles and hearing accounts from friends and colleagues, I've heard of the potential health benefits of improving the diet. I have dabbled in routines such as meatless Mondays and going beef-less although these were motivated more by wanting to reduce impact environmentally. However I had never put together a controlled diet used to explore my own health.

I consider myself to be a healthy individual. I tend to cook 80% of my meals rather than eat out, and am, in my opinion, aware of what I consume and always try to exercise regularly through a mix of climbing, biking, body weight exercises. But in my latest lab results I found out I was prediabetic (A1C levels) which took me completely by surprise!

Furthermore, I've always had mysterious chronic symptoms that I could never understand. This includes inflammation of certain parts of skin and dryness in the throat. These have impacted things I love to do including climbing and singing so I felt compelled to understand but so far I've had little success in finding the root cause.

Cynthia (my wife) studies functional medicine and reads about metabolism. We discuss these topics regularly and are aware of how important the gut microbiome is to overall body health. The whole concept makes perfect sense to me, as someone who works with microorganisms and designs fermentation experiments as part of my day job, I think of us as giant fermenters and that our microbes influence us more than we think. What we feed the microbes will obviously have a large impact on how we feel/behave. One takeaway is today’s diet has evolved to have so much more processed sugars and coincides with a steep rise of diabetes/obesity. Overwhelming amounts of research demonstrates these diseases are related to inflammation, and that the gut plays a huge role.

Cynthia proposed we do a elimination diet.

The concept of the [elimination diet](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/anti-inflammatory-diet/) is this: remove foods commonly known to cause sensitivities in the gut. There are many variations of this out there (Whole30, low FODMAP) and ultimately it depends what the objective is. By removal of certain foods we can see how the gut, and the body, behaves in the absence of these foods. After a period, usually about 3 weeks of cleansing, certain foods would be **re-introduced** and symptoms would be tracked to see if these symptoms could be pinpointed to certain foods.

However there were challenges to getting started. What recipes to use? How to source and prepare all of the foods? How to balance it with work/life? How bad was the experience going to be?

### Motivations

**_Health motivation_** - Would the chronic symptoms go away? Better yet could I discover what foods are linked to certain symptoms?

**_Experimentation_** - this was an experiment and I was interested to see the effects for myself. Self-Process development y’all.

**_Challenge_** – See if I could follow through. I knew from the get-go it would require a lot of planning and changes to habits. I like food.

### Plan Details

A 21-day gut cleansing diet with these guiding points:

- No grains (rice, bread, noodles,
- No gluten (bread, flour, soy sauce)
- No legumes (chickpeas, lentils, beans)
- No dairy (butter, milk, cheese)
- Heavy limit on added sugars
- No fructose (only berries)
- No eggs (specific to me, food sensitivity)
- No soy (Tofu, soy sauce)
- No processed foods
- No to certain oils (canola, vegetable)
- Yes fish, chicken, pork, beef
- Yes berries
- Yes leafy greens
- Yes mushrooms
- Yes to certain nuts (almonds, macademia)
- Yes olive oil, coconut oil

Holy moly that's a lot of restrictions! In addition:

- Supplements of saccharomyces.
- Digestion aids.
- Magnesium
- Berbere

Reintroduction phase would focus on 4 foods/main areas:

- Eggs
- Dairy
- Soy
- Wheat

**_So how did it go?_**

### Week 1

Week 1 was all about acclimation and the body adjusting to these different meals and snacks. Some of these required more effort to adapt to due my chocolate/fruit eating habit. We had chocolate berry smoothies in the morning, and celery/carrots for snacks. The first big meals consisted of herb baked fish and tomato soup, as well as turkey lettuce wraps.

I immediately noticed there was no sleepiness/grogginess after meals, or any desire to take naps (which is unusual for me). The feeling of food comas after meals went away completely. The first few days I was peeing a lot and had to replenish by drinking lots of water. Also there was no bloating whatsoever after meals which was a revelation.

Another observation - it was tough to control snacking. I realized how many snacks I eat at work (as someone who takes full advantage of this)

### Week 2

I felt the fruits of the labor kicking in. This week I had the best poo of my life. Energy was very good throughout the week - I describe it as a continuous hum of energy. I had expected to feel less energetic in physical activities such as climbing but my performance was as good as ever. I also discovered new snacks (carrots and celery sticks with almond butter gets old pretty fast). Masala peas from Berkeley Bowl!!!

### Week 3

Things got tougher in the 3rd week. I noticed my enthusiasm was slowing down due to eating a lot of salads for meals. I also noticed I was getting cranky - I blame this on excessivly low sugar.

### Reintroduction

We introduced the following foods back into diet. 2 days on for each type of food then 3 days off before reintroducing the next food.

- Eggs. There were stomach pains after the first meal with eggs. It only seemed to be problem for the first meal.
- Tofu. Felt fine except for one meal where we overstuffed with too much tofu during hotpot.
- Dairy. No issues.
- Wheat. Felt sleepy the whole day. Unsure if it was due to excess carbs or traceable to gluten.

### Summary of observations:

During the course of this experiment we tracked and quantified things such as headaches, severity of acne, bowel movement...etc. We even tried quantifying some more subjective things such as energy levels, irritability, and focus. Here were the main observations:

- Energy - I felt like I could keep going most days in terms of work/schoolwork/daily tasks. A constant hum is how I describe it.
- Physical Performance – Felt really good, as good as I’ve ever felt. Could climb at the same levels and do the same amount of pullups.
- Irritability – By the end, Inoticed I was getting crankier.
- Weight loss - No change any weight. Cynthia lost 9 lbs in 6 weeks!

### Was the diet successful?

Did I discover any foods that explained symptoms! Yes! It was a rich learning experience and I definitely found links for types of foods that affected energy levels. And bloatiness.

Did it cure all of my mystery chronic symptoms? No - although I wasn't expecting to figure out the answer to all my problems.

Increased awareness - Now I do more research when choosing foods and check ingredient labels for everything. I have much more awareness on what foods contain sugars and carbs.

I saw firsthand positive effects of eating less sugar.

I really like the increased energy and ‘cleaner’ feeling digestion. I used to get upset stomach that would immobilize me/make me want to lie down certain days. I felt a more consistent ‘good’ energy.

### Other takeways:

Challenges in execution – it takes A LOT of effort to come up with a plan for meals and follow through. More on this later.

Be deliberate in what sugars to eat. I'll still eat sugar, but will avoid white processed sugar, white bread. I used to have unlimited allowance of sugars but now I will track/limit my intake.

Eating salads repeatedly can get old. Variety is important.

Personal goal to shift diet to more veggies. For meals I used to have 30% protein, 50% carbs, 20% veggies. Now my goal is to have 40% protein, 40% veggies, 20% carbs.
