- 4 tbsp almond butter
- 4 tbsp cocoa powder
- 4 tbsp chia seeds
- 2 cups unsweetened almond milk (oat milk, coconut milk ok)
- 2 cups water
- 2 cups power greens blend (spinach, chard, kale). I roughly do 4 handfuls.
- 2 cups frozen berries. I roughly do 4 handfuls.

I add the ingredients generally in sequence. Chia seeds should be soaked in water beforehand so they have time to expand/soften before blending. Makes roughly 4 servings.
