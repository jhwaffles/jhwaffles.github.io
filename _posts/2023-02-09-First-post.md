## First Elimination Diet

Over the past year I’ve been experimenting through diet. What kind of experiments you ask?

I have always had an interest in experimenting with food and diet. Through reading articles and hearing accounts from friends and colleagues, I've heard of the potential health benefits of improving the diet. I have dabbled in routines such as meatless Mondays and going beef-less although these were motivated more by wanting to reduce impact environmentally. However I had never put together a diet plan to explore my own health.

I consider myself to be a healthy individual. I tend to cook 80% of my meals rather than eat out, and am, in my opinion, aware of what I consume and always try exercise regularly through a mix of climbing, biking, body weight exercises. But in my latest lab results I found out I was prediabetic (A1C levels) which took me completely by surprise!

Furthermore, I've always had chronic symptoms that I could never understand. This includes inflammation of certain parts of skin, a feeling of hotness and dryness in the throat. These have impacted things I love to do including climbing and singing so I felt compelled to understand but with little success thus far.

Cynthia (my wife) studies functional medicine and reads about metabolism. We discuss these topics regularly and are aware of how important the gut microbiome is to overall body health (-Book plug- I contain multitudes). The whole concept makes perfect sense to me, as someone who works with microorganisms and designs fermentation experiments as part of my day job, I’m a believer we are just a giant fermenter and that our microbes control more than we think. What we feed the microbes will obviously have a large impact on how we feel/behave. One takeaway is today’s diet has evolved to have so much more processed sugars and coincides with an onsite of a rise of diabetes/obesity (-Link-). Cynthia was convinced that these were all related to inflammation, and that it started with the gut. (Gut leakiness link/books?).

Cynthia proposed we do a elimination diet.

The concept of the elimination diet is this: remove foods commonly known to cause sensitivities in the gut. This includes many common foods such as wheat (gluten), corn, as well as many processed foods. By doing this we can see how the gut, and the body, behaves in the absence of these foods. (-Link-). After a period, usually about 3 weeks of cleansing, certain foods would be **re-introduced** and symptoms would be tracked, to see if cause-and-effect could be pinpointed to certain foods. This was **interesting** to me as it would be a more controlled way to diagnose what is going on with the body.

However there were challenges to getting started. What recipes to use? How to source and prepare all of the foods? How to balance it with work/life?

**After some discussions, we agreed to commit to the diet.**

### Motivations

**_Health motivation_** - Would the chronic symptoms go away? Better yet could I discover what foods are linked to certain symptoms?
**_Experience_** – Readings and more awareness of how important the gut microbiome is to overall body health. I wanted first hand experience.

**_Experimentation_** - this was an experiment and I was interested to see the effects for myself. Process development y’all.

**_Challenge_** – See if I could follow through. I knew from the get-go it would require a lot of planning and changes to habits. I am accustomed to diet and taste and.

### Plan Details

What:

A 21-day gut cleansing diet that primarily focused on:

- No grains (rice, bread, noodles,
- No gluten (bread, flour, soy sauce)
- No legumes (chickpeas, lentils, beans)
- No dairy (butter, milk, cheese)
- Heavy limit on sugars (the worst )
- No fructose (only berries)
- No eggs (specific to me, food sensitivity)
- No soy (Tofu, soy sauce)
- No processed foods

- Yes fish, chicken, pork, beef
- Yes berries
- Yes leafy greens
- Yes mushrooms
- Yes to certain nuts (almonds, macadamia but no peanuts)
- Yes olive oil, coconut oil (No canola,

- Supplements of saccharomyces.
- Digestion aids.
- Magnesium
- Berbere

Reintroduction phase would focus on 4 foods/main areas:

- Eggs (Since I have high sensitity)
- Dairy
- Soy
- Wheat

**_So how did it go?_**

### Week 1

Week 1 was all about acclimating and adjustments. New meals and different types of snacks. No chocolate or only limited selections of fruits. Chocolate berry smoothies in the morning. Celery and carrots for snack. First meals consisted of herb baked fish and tomato soup. Then turkey lettuce wraps.

I immediately noticed there was no sleepiness/grogginess after meals, or any desire to take naps which was something common for me. Literally zero food comas. The first few days I was peeing a lot and had to replenish with water. Also there was no bloating whatsoever after meals which was a revelation.

Another observation - it was tough to control snacking. realizing how many snacks I was eating work (benefits of corporate).

### Week 2

I felt the fruits of the labor kicking. I had the best poo of my life. Like 100/100 on the poo rating scale. It felt like a continuous hum of energy. I had expected to feel less energy in physical activities such as climbing - but felt really good, and performance was as good as ever. Also branched out to new snacks (carrots and celery sticks with almond butter gets old pretty fast). Masala peas.

### Week 3

Things actually got tougher in the 3rd week. I noticed enthusiasm was slowing down due to salads consisting a lot of meals. I also noticed I was getting cranky without sugar/foods I craved.

### Reintroduction

We introduced the following foods back into diet. 2 days on for each type of food then 3 days off before reintroducing the next food.

- Eggs. Felt like stomach problems after the first meal. But then the second meal there were no problems. It makes me think this was shock to the system after going without eggs.
- Tofu. Felt fine except for one meal where we overstuffed with too much tofu during hotpot.
- Dairy. No problems
- Wheat. Felt sleepy the whole day. I wonder if it was a load of carbs or it was the gluten.

### Summary of observations:

During the course of this experiment we tracked and quantified such as how many times acne, headaches, bowel movement... We even tried quantifying some more subjective things such as energy levels, irritability, focus etc. Here were the main observations:

![Symptom](/docs/assets/symptoms.png)

- Energy - I felt like I could keep going most days in terms of work/schoolwork/daily tasks. No stopping. A constant hum is how I describe it.
- Physical Performance – Felt really good, as good as I’ve ever felt. Could climb at the same levels and do the same amount of pullups.
- Irritability – By the end, noticed I was getting crankier.
- Weight loss - No change any weight. Cynthia did (9 lbs in 6 weeks)!

### Was the diet successful?

Did I discover any foods that explained symptoms! Yes! Definitely found links for types of foods that caused low energy. And bloatiness.

Did it cure all of my mystery chronic symptoms? No. don’t know what I was expecting when I came in that I would figure out the solution to all my problems.

Increased awareness - Now I check ingredient labels for everything. Much more awareness where sugars came from.

Saw firsthand positive effects of lower sugar.

Really like the increased energy and ‘cleaner’ feeling digestion. No upset stomachs that immobilize me. More consistent ‘good’ energy.

### Other takeways:

Challenges in execution – it takes A LOT of effort to come up with a plan for meals and follow through. More on this later.

Be deliberate in what sugars to eat. Can still eat sugar, but going to avoid from white processed sugar, white bread. Used to have unlimited allowance. Going to limit.

But happiness = food and taste.
Personal goal - Shift diet to more veggies. Used to do 30% protein 50% carbs 20% veggies. Move to 40% protein, 40% veggies, 20% carbs.
