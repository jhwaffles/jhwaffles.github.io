## First Elimination Diet

Over the past year I’ve been experimenting through diet. What kind of experiments you ask?

I have always had an interest in trying diets and have heard through articles and word of mouth of touted health benefits. I have dabbled into routines such as meatless Mondays, and going beef-less although these were motivated more by wanting to reduce impact environmentally. However I had never put together a diet plan to explore my own health.

I consider myself to be a healthy individual. I tend to cook 80% of my meals rather than eat out, and am, in my opinion, aware of what I consume and always try exercise regularly through a mix of climbing, biking, body weight exercises. But my latest lab results to my surprise I came out as prediabetic (A1C levels)!

Furthermore, always a few nagging symptoms that I could never understand. Inflammation of certain parts of skin. Feeling of inflammation of throat (This could be a whole chapter in itself). Cynthia was convinced that these had to do with inflammation, and that it started with the gut. (Gut leakiness link/books?) For me this this was something never tested and was hope that diet could solve the problems.

Lately my wife Cynthia has been studying functional medicine and reading up on metabolism (Add details). A lot of the readings have taught us awareness of how important the gut microbiome is to overall body health (Link I contain multitudes). The whole concept makes perfect sense to me, as someone who works with microorganisms and designs fermentation experiments as part of my day job, I’m a believer we are just a giant fermenter. So feeding the bugs will obviously have a large impact on how we feel/behave. One takeaway is today’s diet has evolved to have so much more processed sugars and coincides with an onsite of a rise of diabetes/obesity (Link).

Cynthia proposed we do a elimination diet.

The concept of the elimination diet is this – remove foods commonly known cause or sensitivities to the gut. This includes many common foods such as wheat (gluten), corn, as well as many processed foods. By doing this we can see how the gut, and the body, behaves in the absence of these foods. (Link). After a period, usually about 3 weeks, (likely due to half life, link), where these foods are eliminated, certain foods would be **re-introduced** and symptoms would be tracked, to see if cause-and-effect could be pinpointed to certain foods. This was **interesting** to me as it would be a more controlled way to diagnose what is going on with the body.

However there were challenges to getting started. What recipes to use? How to source and prepare all of the foods? How to balance it with work/life?

## After some discussions, we agreed to commit to the diet.

### Motivations

**_Health motivation_** - Would the chronic symptoms go away? Better yet could I discover what foods are linked to certain symptoms?
**_Experience_** – Readings and more awareness of how important the gut microbiome is to overall body health. I wanted first hand experience.

**_Experimentation_** - this was an experiment and I was interested to see the effects for myself. Process development y’all.

**_Challenge_** – See if I could follow through. I knew from the get-go it would require a lot of planning and changes to habits. I am accustomed to diet and taste and.

### Plan Details

What:

- A 21-day gut cleansing diet that primarily focused on:
- No grains (rice, bread, noodles,

- Heavy limit on sugars (the worst )
- No fructose (only berries)
- No eggs (specific to me, food sensitivity)
- No soy (Tofu, soy sauce)
- No processed foods

Yes fish, chicken, pork, beef

Yes olive oil, coconut oil (No canola,

Supplements of saccharomyces.
Digestion aids.

Reintroduction phase would focus on 4 foods/main areas:
Eggs (Since I have high sensitity)
Dairy
Soy

**_So how did it go?_**

### Week 1

It was all about adjustment, and adjustments. New meals and different types of snacks. No chocolate or only limited selections of fruits. Chocolate berry smoothies in the morning. Celery and carrots for snack. First meals consisted of herb baked fish and tomato soup. Then turkey lettuce wraps.

I immediately noticed there was no sleepiness/grogginess after meals, or any desire to take naps which was something common for me. Literally zero food comas. The first few days I was peeing a lot and had to replenish with water. Also there was no bloating whatsoever after meals which was a revelation.

Another observation - it was tough to control snacking. realizing how many snacks I was eating work (benefits of corporate).

###Week 2

I felt the fruits of the labor kicking. I had the best poo of my life. Like 100/100 on the poo rating scale. It felt like a continuous hum of energy. I had expected to feel less energy in physical activities such as climbing - but felt really good, and performance was as good as ever. Also branched out to new snacks (carrots and celery sticks with almond butter gets old pretty fast). Masala peas.
